# Pi-fi - Music in the key of Pi

This project is an exploration of the strange properties of the number Pi
(infinitely non-repeating sequence of digits), using Angular and the HTML5 Web
Audio API to explore what Pi "sounds like," when mapped over varying musical
scales.

Using Angular to control the parameters of the audio in real-time, the
application allows a user to explore and experiment with different oscillator
types, speeds, and, in the future, different scales.

By combining cutting-edge web technologies, I hope to create an experience that
will surprise and intrigue users and illustrate the beauty of interpreting
digital data in unexpected ways.
